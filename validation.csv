Preset product tax code: A product tax code is a classification of your product or service for Stripe Tax. We use this to make sure that the correct tax rate is applied to your transactions.

You must select the correct product tax code for your product or service. We use this if you don’t explicitly specify a tax_code, which maps to tax codes, on your products or in product_data on your transactions. Learn about products, prices, and tax codes.

Default shipping tax code: A shipping tax code determines what type of tax treatment to apply when shipping (delivery) fees are added to the price that you charge. In some countries, the tax rate used to calculate the correct amount of tax on your product is the same rate that’s applied to the shipping fees. Some countries have a unique tax rate for shipping fees.

If you’re selling digital goods or services, or if you’re located in the EU, you don’t need to select anything. Otherwise, you should select the most appropriate tax treatment for your business. We use this if you don’t explicitly specify a tax code on a shipping rate in a Checkout session.

To send card details from Stripe’s vault, you must Create a ForwardingRequest. This includes providing a Forwarding Config, the request body to send to the destination endpoint, and the PaymentMethod or PaymentIntent to include in the request.

We create the Forwarding Config for your account in the setup process and provide you with the ID of the Config to include in your API requests. This Config defines the specific third-party API endpoint, parameters, and credentials that you can use with the Forwarding API.
The request body is the API request that you want to send to the destination endpoint (for example, the charge request you send to another processor). Leave any field where you normally input your customer’s card details blank.
The PaymentMethod or PaymentIntent enables Stripe to identify your customer’s card details within Stripe’s vault and insert that data into the request body.
For security purposes, Stripe verifies that the credentials for the third-party API used in the request match those that you provide during setup.

In the example below, the destination endpoint expects an Idempotency-Key header and accepts a JSON body with the payment details.
